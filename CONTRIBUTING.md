# Contributing to the Suno Prompt Engineering Guide
First off, thank you for considering contributing! This project is a community effort to help creators understand and master Suno's AI. Every contribution, from a simple typo fix to a new in-depth analysis, is valuable.

## How to Contribute
I welcome contributions in several forms. The most common ways to help are by reporting issues, suggesting enhancements, or submitting changes directly via pull requests.

### Reporting Issues or Suggesting Enhancements
If you find a mistake, have a question, or want to suggest a new section or analysis, the best way to do so is by opening an issue on GitHub.
* **Check existing issues first**: Someone might have already reported the same thing.
* **Be clear and descriptive**: For a bug report, describe the issue and where you found it. For a suggestion, clearly outline the new idea and why it would be helpful.

### GitHub Issues with Detailed Suggestions
If you want to contribute content but don't want to deal with Git or pull requests, you can submit your suggestions directly through GitHub Issues:

1. **Go to the Issues tab** in the repository
2. **Click "New Issue"**
3. **Use a descriptive title** like "Suggestion: Add section on reverb techniques" or "Content correction: Fix inaccuracy in vocal style guide"
4. **In the description, include your full suggested text** - write out exactly what you think should be added, changed, or corrected
5. **Provide context** - explain where this content should go and why it would be helpful
6. **Submit the issue** - I'll review it and incorporate approved suggestions into the guide

This method requires no technical knowledge - just a GitHub account to submit issues.

### GitHub Discussions
For brainstorming ideas, asking questions, or collaborating on larger content additions, use GitHub Discussions:

1. **Navigate to the Discussions tab** in the repository
2. **Choose the appropriate category**:
   - **Ideas** - for suggesting new sections or features
   - **Q&A** - for questions about Suno or the guide
   - **General** - for other project-related conversations
3. **Start a new discussion** with a clear title
4. **Share your thoughts, draft content, or questions** - this is a more informal space for collaboration
5. **Engage with others** - discussions allow for back-and-forth conversation before formal implementation

Discussions are perfect for developing ideas that might eventually become issues or pull requests.

### Submitting Changes (Pull Requests)
If you want to directly contribute a change, whether it's fixing a typo or adding a new document, please follow these steps:
1.  **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page to create your own copy.
2.  **Create a New Branch**: In your forked repository, create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name, like `fix-typo-in-readme` or `add-analysis-of-weak-tags`.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```
3.  **Make Your Changes**: Edit the files in your new branch. Whether you're writing documentation or updating the JSON data, make sure your changes are clear and well-formatted.
4.  **Commit Your Changes**: Write a clear, concise commit message that explains what you've changed.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Fix: Corrected typo in Core Concepts document"
    ```
5.  **Push to Your Fork**: Push your new branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```
6.  **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository and you should see a prompt to open a pull request from your new branch. Provide a clear title and a detailed description of the changes you've made.

## Code of Conduct
To ensure this is a welcoming space for everyone, I have a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/theelderemo/suno-prompt-engineering-guide/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Style Guide
To maintain consistency throughout the project, please adhere to the following style guides.

### Documentation (`.md` files)
* **Formatting**: Use standard Markdown. Use hashes (`#`, `##`) for headers, backticks (`) for inline code, and triple backticks (```) for code blocks.
* **Tone**: Keep the language clear, accessible, and informative. The goal is to help users, not to be overly academic.
* **Citations**: If you are adding information derived from the provided `HowSunoWorks.txt` or `SunosDataSet.txt` files, you **must** cite it using the `` format, just as in the existing documents. Each piece of information requires its own citation.

### Data Files (`.json` files)
* **Formatting**: Ensure any changes to the JSON files maintain valid JSON syntax. Use a linter or online validator if you are unsure.
* **Integrity**: Do not add or modify the core data unless you are correcting a clear transcription error from the source documents. If you have new data, please open an issue to discuss it first.

Thank you again for your interest in making this guide better!
